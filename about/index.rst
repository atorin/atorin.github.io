Hi! And welcome to this blog!

My name is Alberto and I am a postdoc in the `Acoustics and Audio Group <http://www.acoustics.ed.ac.uk>`_ at the University of Edinburgh. 

Here you will find some things I find worth sharing about my research and my
spare time projects. You might also want to visit `my personal page
<http://www.albertotorin.it>`_.
