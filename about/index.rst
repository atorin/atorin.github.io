Hi! And welcome to this blog!

My name is Alberto and I currently work as a technical writer for the `Digital
Transformation Team <https://teamdigitale.governo.it/en/>`_ and the Italian
Government. Previously, I was a PhD student and a Postdoctoral Research
Associate in the `Acoustics and Audio Group <http://www.acoustics.ed.ac.uk>`_
at the University of Edinburgh. 

Here you will find some things I find worth sharing about my research and
my spare time projects. In particular, you can find posts about numerical simulation with the finite difference method, sound synthesis and a few hacks and tricks that I found along the way.
