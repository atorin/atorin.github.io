Hi! And welcome to this blog!

My name is Alberto and I currently work as a technical writer for the `Digital Transformation Team <https://teamdigitale.governo.it/en/>`_ and the Italian Government. Previously, I was a PhD student and a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the `Acoustics and Audio Group <http://www.acoustics.ed.ac.uk>`_ at the University of Edinburgh. 

Here you will find some things I find worth sharing about my research and
my spare time projects. You might also want to visit `my personal page
