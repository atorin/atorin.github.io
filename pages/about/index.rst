Hi! And welcome to this blog!

My name is Alberto and I currently work as a freelance data scientist for
`Toptal <https://www.toptal.com/#incorporate-nothing-but-devoted-prolancers>`_. 
I am also a Python developer and a technical writer. 

Recently, I worked as technical writer for the 
`Digital Transformation Team <https://teamdigitale.governo.it/en/>`_ and the Italian
Government. I was previously a PhD student and a Postdoctoral Research
Associate in the `Acoustics and Audio Group <http://www.acoustics.ed.ac.uk>`_
at the University of Edinburgh. 

Here you will find some things I find worth sharing about my research and my
spare time projects. In particular, you can find posts about numerical
simulation with the finite difference method, sound synthesis and a few hacks
and tricks that I found along the way.
